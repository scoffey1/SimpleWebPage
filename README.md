# SimpleWebPage
This is the skeleton of a website that could be hooked up to a database if the user wanted.
There is a mix of in-line CSS and an external file.
The font and color style were picked randomly and can be easily changed if CSS is changed
to just external and no internal CSS.

UPDATE
//1.I moved some inline CSS to an external file
//2.I changed to a darker layout and added a gradient to the Home page
//3. I couldn'nt get the animation and color to work together
//4.There are certain effects in styles.css that aren't implemented
